# FileCollector

Give it a path and one or more file extensions and it will scan all subfolders, grab any matching files, and format their contents as an easy-to-copy string.  
It was made in like 30 minutes and is 100% ChatGPT-written, so expect bugs.

## How to Set It Up

1. Clone this repo:
```bash git clone https://github.com/your-username/FileCollector.git```
2. Go into the project directory:
 ```cd FileCollector```
3. Install dependencies:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. Run the app:
```python app.py```
Open your browser and go to:
```http://127.0.0.1:5000/```

Enjoy that bad-looking design.
